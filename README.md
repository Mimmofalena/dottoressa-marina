# dottoressa-marina

This is a landing page of a doctor. The doctor will display useful informations to patients that include but are not limited to : place, timetable, prices and much more.

This project uses REACT JS framework.

I used Material UI to style the website.

I have embedded GOOGLE MAPS API to show where the doctor is located. 

I have used FORMIK and YUP for contact validation and EMAILJS as mean of contact.

I have used scroll react to scroll up the page smoothly.

Any improvements suggestions are welcomed.
